Data Preprocessing: Raw sequencing data undergo quality control, adapter trimming, and quality trimming to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
Read Alignment: Sequencing reads are aligned to a reference genome to determine their genomic locations.
Variant Calling: Genetic variants such as SNPs and indels are identified by comparing aligned reads to the reference genome.
Variant Annotation: Variants are annotated with relevant genomic information and functional consequences.
Variant Filtering and Prioritization: Variants are filtered based on criteria like allele frequency and predicted functional impact to prioritize potentially pathogenic variants.
Variant Interpretation: Filtered variants are interpreted using literature and databases to assess clinical significance.
Clinical Reporting: A comprehensive report summarizing identified variants and their clinical implications is generated.
Quality Assurance and Validation: Measures are taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis pipeline through validation and quality control checks.

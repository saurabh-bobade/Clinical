# Clinical
Clinical Genomics Pipeline: This pipeline analyzes genetic data to diagnose genetic disorders and guide personalized patient care. It follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing: Raw sequencing data undergo preprocessing for quality control and trimming.
Read Alignment: Sequencing reads are aligned to a reference genome.
Variant Calling: Genetic variants are identified.
Variant Annotation: Variants are annotated with genomic information.
Variant Filtering: Variants are filtered based on criteria like allele frequency and functional impact.
Variant Interpretation: Clinical significance of variants is assessed.
Clinical Reporting: A comprehensive report summarizing findings is generated.
Quality Assurance: Measures are taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the pipeline.
